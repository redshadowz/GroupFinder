Groupfinder Addon for Vanilla Wow 1.12.1

I used the core of the Calltoarms addon, ripped everything out of it except its main layout and menus, then added a lot of chat parsing.
It started out as just a way to more easily block annoying spam and to more easily parse world chat, but then I decided to make an attempt
at writing a Chinese to English translator.

I mainly need more Chinese words/phrases to add to the dictionary in GFTranslation.lua, but I would also love ideas or anything else that might be useful.
