# Groupfinder
Groupfinder Addon for Vanilla Wow 1.12.1

I used the core of the Calltoarms addon, ripped everything out of it except its main layout and menus, then added a lot of chat parsing.

Update 4/4/2025: I didn't realize anyone was using this addon. I fixed a few things and made /who an option, but I removed the translation(Chinese to English) entirely for now(plan to move it into a separate addon). I'll be updating again in a couple days when I get everything done.
