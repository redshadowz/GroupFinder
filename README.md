# GroupFinder
Group finder Addon for Vanilla Wow 1.12.1 based on the CallToArms addon(with Turtle WoW support).  

Update 2/22/2026... Been working on chat-processing again, and general performance tweaks, and just trying to fix everything and clean it up. I was hoping to finish work on the group log, but I have barely started. I'll probably start tomorrow. Which means I'll have to do some groups/dungeons for testing. Rofl.  

This isn't simply a group finder that searches world chat for groups. This is a massive chat filtering tool that prevents chat spam and allows you to see only what you want to see. Also comes with unlimited Blacklist/Ignore, Chat Logs, Whisper Logs, and a Group Maker tool.  

>[Auto Filter] - Shows only the groups near your level(default: 5 level difference).  
[Play Sound] - Plays a sound when a group matches your filters.  
[Show LFM] - Shows groups of people 'Looking for more'.  
[Show LFG] - Shows groups of people 'Looking for a group'.  
[Group Filters Dungeons/Raids/Quests/Other] - Shows/Hides groups for Dungeons, Raids, Quests, or Others.  
["Keywords"] - Enter text to filter groups. For multiple searches separate with commas. The dropdown auto-populates based on your level.  
[Chat Filters] - Allows you to show/hide Guild Recruitment, Group, Trade, and Chat messages. Group messages can also be shown next to the minimap. All messages are recorded in the 'Log'.  
[Auto /Who] - Searches for classes/levels through '/who' or through the friendslist(Turtle WoW limits /who).  

>[Announce Group] - Sends your LFG message to world chat and repeats every 2-30 minutes(Announce Timer).  
[LFG Button] - Toggles a menu to generate a LFG message automatically. Just select LFM/LFG, Dungeon/Raid, roles, and group size.  
[Who Button] - Toggles a menu to help you find players. Select the class and level you're looking for, press 'Get Who' to generate a list of names, then click 'Whisper' to send an invite message.  
Note: The addon will not message the same person more than once every 15 minutes.  

>[Show Formatted Chat] - Formats chat messages to show player levels and class colors.   
[Enable System Filtering] - Blocks/limits server messages for group invites, quest sharing, server spam, and NPC 'say/emote' messages.  
[Always Show Guild/Friends] - Messages from friends/guildies will always be shown(ignores chat filters).  
[Enable Spam Filtering] - The Spam Filter will block repeating messages.  
[Enable Auto Blacklist] - Automatically blacklists players who 'spam' if they are below the level threshold.  
[Use Arial Font] - Switches to the Arial font.
[Use Friendslist for /who] - Attempts to get Class/Level information through the friendslist. I'm not sure if this works on all servers.
